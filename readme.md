Transporting Data Over the Web

I am currently a student taking General Assemblyâ€™s Programming Boot camp in DC and recently created an application for one of our projects using a lot AJAX calls to our backend and a third Party API in order to create a real-time, single page application. I had very little exposure to AJAX or Single Page Applications prior to starting this project and wanted to give a broad overview for any other fellow beginners as well starting out as well!

In this blog post I will be discussing a few different ways of pushing data over the web between the client and the server, and then implement a simple messaging chat application using Nodejs, Express, and Socket.io.
